This is just an example Android project. The functionality is only basic.

The app keeps a goal - number of tasks that have to be done. The tasks are completed by employees. The app shows how much work each employee have done in comparison to each other.

How to use the app?
-------------------

First of all, specify the goal by clicking on the current goal. Then, add all of your employees and remove the examples by long-clicking them. After that, when somebody finishes a task, click on his line and one task will be added. Simple.

How does it look like?
